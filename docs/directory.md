## Directory Structure

By default, cobalt mirrors your source file hierarchy in the destination,
helping you get closer to a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get experience.

Files or folders that help generate the site but aren't directly part of the output
are "hidden" from cobalt by prefixing them with a `_`.

The default Cobalt site usually looks like this
```
.
|- _cobalt.yml
|- _layouts
|  |- default.liquid
|- _includes
|  |- header.liquid
|- _data
|  |- movies.json
|- _sass
|  |- base.scss
|- _site
|  |- index.html
|- _defaults
|  |- pages.md
|  |- posts.md
|- posts
|  |- cats.md
|- _drafts
|  |- dogs.md
|- _syntaxes
|  |- language.sublime-syntax
|- index.liquid
```
